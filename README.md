## Profile

I am a software developer and data engineer whose work is governed by a single operating principle: clarity of purpose at every layer of a system. Trained formally in data engineering at the Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán and further hardened through intensive full-stack development at Generation México, I approach each project as a structured problem requiring not merely a solution, but a defensible one - legible to the next engineer who inherits it.

My focus rests on open-source tooling, backend architecture, and data-pipeline construction. Where others reach for abstraction, I reach for precision.

## Selected Operations

### IMU Motion Analysis - Canine Movement Classification *(2025)*
Applied sensor-calibration algorithms to improve data-extraction precision by 20 %. Deployed the Madgwick filter for orientation estimation and classified activity states via Random Forest, both achieving 80 % accuracy. Precision was not incidental - it was engineered.

### HERMIN - Phone-Number Generation Optimization *(2024)*
Restructured mobile-number generation logic, reducing dependence on purely stochastic output by 50 %. Integrated FireDucks alongside Matplotlib to render high-volume datasets comprehensible under constrained processing conditions.

### Virtual Library System - UPY Backend *(2024)*
Designed and deployed an internal library platform for university personnel, automating resource management through a structured MySQL data layer. Query performance was optimized to sustain reliable institutional use over time.

### Collections Strategy Automation - Macropay *(2025)*
Monitored KPIs across a customer-service center via CCC and Power BI. Automated critical back-office processes with Python, measurably reducing execution time. Managed data ingestion from Amazon S3 and refined collections strategy through Excel pivot-table analysis.
